# 6. Server Rules

Don’t be mean
Be respectful to other users and their opinions on the server.
Don’t shove your opinion down someone’s throat.
Constructive argument is allowed. However, if it turns into insults and disrespect, you may be banned mid argument so you will lose the argument (and give you time to cool off)
This server is not your personal dating website. Refrain from sliding into people's DMs unsolicited
